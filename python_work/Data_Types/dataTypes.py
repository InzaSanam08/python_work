# Built-in Data Types
# In programming, data type is an important concept.

# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

# Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

# Text Type:       	str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	    dict
# Set Types:	    set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	    bool
# Binary Types:	    bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# None Type:	    NoneType


# Text Type : str :-

x = 'Programing World'
a = 'My first program'

# Numeric Types : int:-

x = 11
a = 44

# Numeric Types : float:-

x = 22.0
a = 11.5

# Sequence Types : list :-

x = ['Hello','Programers','world']
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

#  Sequence Types : tuple:-

x = ('its','Time','To','Achieve','Goals')
a = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

# Mapping Type : dict:-

x = {'Name':'Ahmed','Age': 16,'City':'Karachi'}
a = {1:'Apple',2:'Banana',3:'Kiwi' }
