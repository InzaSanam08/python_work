# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators


# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

# Operator	Name	
#    +      Addition	
#    -  	Subtraction
#    *  	Multiplication		
#    /  	Division		
#    %	    Modulus
#   **  	Exponentiation	
#   //	    Floor division	x 


x = 7
a = 3
print(x+a)

b = x+a
print(b)




# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

# Operator	Example	Same As	Try it
#   =	
#   +=	
#   -=	
#   *=	
#   /=	
#   %=	
#   //=	
#   **=	
#   &=	
#   |=	
#   ^=	
#   >>=	
#   <<=	
#   :=	
# print(x)
