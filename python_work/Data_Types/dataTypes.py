# Built-in Data Types
# In programming, data type is an important concept.

# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

# Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

# Text Type:       	str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	    dict
# Set Types:	    set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	    bool
# Binary Types:	    bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# None Type:	    NoneType

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

# Text Type : str :-
# Strings
# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

x = 'Programing World'
a = 'My first program'

# Numeric Types : int:-
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

x = 11
a = 44

# Numeric Types : float:-
# Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

x = 22.0
a = 11.5

# Sequence Types : list :-
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Lists are created using square brackets:

x = ['Hello','Programers','world']
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

#  Sequence Types : tuple:-
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
# Tuples are written with round brackets.

x = ('its','Time','To','Achieve','Goals')
a = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

# Mapping Type : dict:-

x = {'Name':'Ahmed','Age': 16,'City':'Karachi'}
a = {1:'Apple',2:'Banana',3:'Kiwi' }

# # Boolean Type : bool:-
# In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
# You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.
# When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

x = True
a = False

# None Type : None:-

x = None
